# Real time stock process platform

This is a practice project combining various big data frameworks to achieve real time stock process on docker.

Aim to get familiar to big data tools including:

* Kafka
* Cassandra
* Redis
* Spark
* Zookeeper

TODO: This project will be built again on AWS with more powerful machines and  consideration on network such as security groups.
